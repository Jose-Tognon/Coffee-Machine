# Coffee Machine

This project is a simple Coffee Machine simulation developed as a study exercise for understanding **class methods** in programming.

## Description

The Coffee Machine project demonstrates the use of classes and methods to simulate the basic operations of a coffee machine, such as making coffee, checking ingredients, and managing machine status.

## Features

- Create a coffee machine object
- Use class methods to perform actions like:
  - make coffee
  - check ingredients
  - Check machine status
- Practice object-oriented programming concepts
